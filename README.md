# Advanced-Toxic-Comment-Classifier

ðŸ“œ Project Description
 
The Toxic Comment Classifier is an Advanced machine-learning project developed to detect and categorize toxic content in user comments. By employing a multi-label classification strategy, it addresses the critical challenges faced by online platforms in identifying harmful language. Designed and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment, the project utilizes cutting-edge techniques for feature extraction and classification.
This advanced solution is deployed for real-time toxic comment detection, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a Kaggle dataset to achieve an impressive accuracy of 95.31%. The workflow encompasses comprehensive preprocessing, feature extraction, and detailed evaluation, enabling effective identification of hate speech, harassment, and offensive language.
